# pedestrian_traffic_predict_model
This project is to use binary classification to Predict whether count would go above 2000 for the hours between 9:00am and midnight.
And use regression to Predict the possible count for the hours between 9:00am and midnight.


This is the main code. As data is more than 100 MB, you can contact me if you need the datasource.
